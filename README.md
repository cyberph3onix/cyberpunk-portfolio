# Cyberpunk Portfolio 👾

A retro-futuristic portfolio website built using **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Framer Motion**.  
This project is part of my self-learning journey to understand modern web development and how to use **Git & GitHub** for version control and deployment.

## 🚧 What I'm Learning

- 💻 Git & GitHub workflows: cloning, pushing, committing, and collaboration basics
- - 🌐 Hosting and deploying websites
- 🧠 How React components work and how data flows between them
- 🎨 How TailwindCSS handles responsive design and utility-based styling
- 🎞️ Framer Motion for subtle animations


## 🛠️ What I Did

- Used an AI-generated boilerplate as a base
- Customized UI elements, text, themes, and layout
- Deployed and maintained the project using GitHub
- Currently learning how to add more interactivity and features and slowly making the website better and better. 

Note: I have filled the skills section with placeholders so the skill sections may not indicate the skills that i currently have, I'll fix it later

## 🌟 Why This Project?

Rather than doing basic projects, I chose to learn through building something fun, cool and something I can learn from.  
I didn’t know React or Tailwind before this — I’m learning by doing. Every commit reflects progress in my understanding.
